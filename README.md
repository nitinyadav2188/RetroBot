# 🕹️ RetroBot — Your 8-Bit Browser Assistant

RetroBot is a pixelated, moody virtual assistant built for your browser — think Clippy meets a Nintendo cartridge.  
It lives in a draggable window, speaks in sassy retro dialogue, and helps you manage your **Todo list**, **Calendar**, and **Music** — all while looking cool in glorious 8-bit style.

---

## 🎮 Features

- 🎤 **8-Bit Personality**  
  RetroBot talks to you with pixel-perfect sass and has dynamic moods: Happy, Sleepy, and Annoyed.

- ✅ **Todo List Manager**  
  Add, track, and manage tasks with a few nostalgic clicks.

- 📅 **Mini Calendar**  
  Schedule events using a classic date picker and view saved reminders.

- 🎵 **Music Player**  
  Plays retro tunes using the built-in `<audio>` player. Easily swappable with your own MP3 files.

- 🧠 **Modular Architecture**  
  Toggle modules (todo/calendar/music) independently — more modules can be added easily.

- 💾 **Data Persistence (WIP)**  
  Designed to persist your tasks and mood using `localStorage`.
